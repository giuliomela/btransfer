#' Computing transfer factors for unit value transfer with income adjustment
#'
#' \code{bt_transfer} returns a data frame with all parameters used to calculate
#' transfer factors which can be in turn used to perform value transfers in
#' environmental and health economics.
#'
#' This function allows the calculation of transfer factors to be used to perform
#' unit value transfers with income adjustments. Such factors are scalars that must be
#' multiplied by the original value. The function allows the user to select the
#' study site (country in which the original study that identified the value to be
#' transferred was carried out) and the policy sites. The latter can be a group of
#' countries or an aggregate of countries. Study and policy years can also be selected,
#' as well as whether the original estimate is expressed in US dollars or euro (default).
#' Finally, the function considers different values for income elasticity of the
#' willingness to pay for the environmental/health good to be transferred (epsilon)
#' according to the policy country's GNI per capita. More information on value
#' transfer techniques can be found in Navrud and Ready (2007).
#' The function works also in case policy year is set to a future year. Parameters like
#' GDP per capita and GNI per capita (Needed to identify the appropriate epsilon)
#' are calculated, for the policy year in the future, using average growth rates
#' of the last n-year period. In this case, n (the length of the time window over
#' which the growth averages are calculated) is equal to the time horizon defined
#' by the policy year (i.e. if the policy year is 2030 and the last year with
#' available data is 2020, the horizon is set to 10 years).
#'
#' @param study_site A single string. The name of the country in which the original
#' study that identified the values to be transferred was carried out. The name can be
#' provided in any language (first letter always capitalized). It is possible to choose
#' also two aggregates: the European Union (\code{EUU}) and the world as a whole (\code{WLD}).
#' The default value is \code{EUU}.
#' @param policy_site A string vector. Names of the countries to which the value must be
#' transferred. It can be either a single string or a vector. Names can be provided in
#' any language. If the policy site is the European Union or the world \code{EUU} and
#' \code{WLD} must be used respectively.
#' @param study_yr Numeric. The year in which the original values was estimated. Default
#' is 2016, year about which the estimates provided by the European Commission's Handbook
#' on the external cost of the transport sector refer to.
#' @param policy_yr Numeric. The ywar to which values must be transferred. Default is 2019. It
#' is possible to define also future years up to 2050.
#' @param aggregate A single string. It can assume three different values. If \code{no} transfer
#' factors are provided for each country selected via \code{policy_site}. If \code{yes} a transfer
#' factor is calculated for the aggregate made up by the countries selected via \code{policy_site}.
#' If \code{row} a transfer factor is calculated for the aggregate "rest of the world" (world
#' minus countries selected via \code{policy_site}).
#' @param study_currency A single string. It can assume three values: \code{EUR} (the default),
#' \code{USD} or \code{LCU}. It refers to the currency in which the original values is expressed.
#' In case \code{LCU} is chosen, the GDP deflator and the currency considered are those of the study site.
#' In case \code{EUR} or \code{USD} are provided the Euro area and the US GDP deflators are used
#' respectively.
#' @param policy_currency A single string. It can assume three values: \code{EUR} (the default),
#' \code{USD} or \code{LCU}. It refers to the currency in which the final value must be expressed.
#' The option \code{LCU} can be chosen only if just one policy site in provided through
#' the paramter \code{policy_site}.
#' @param aggregate_name A single string. In case the value transfer must be perfomed
#' for an aggregate of countries, a name can be provided to be displayed in the
#' output.
#' @return A tibble containing all parameters used and the transfer factor (bt_fct), which
#' is the scalar which the original value must be multiplied by to perform the transfer. Such
#' factor is already adjusted for inflation.
