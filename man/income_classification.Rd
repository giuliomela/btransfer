\description{
This dataset contains the latest available World Bank's income classification based
on gross national income (GNI) per capita (Atlas method). This classification is useful
to identify the most appropriate income elasticity of the willingness to pay for
the environmental/health good to be transferred (epsilon). Values are defined
on the basis of Navrud (2009) and email exchanges with Prof Navrud himself.
